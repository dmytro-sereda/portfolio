    text: `Dima is a standout teammate. A highly talented developer who works hard 
    at mastering his skillset. He continuously pursues knowledge in various subjects 
    and uses his experience well to find clear solutions to difficult technical 
    challenges. He isn't afraid to voice his opinion and regularly gives honest 
    positive feedback. When things are not clear Dima asks the types of questions 
    that help the entire team. If you need someone to present or demo a solution 
    ask Dima because he's an outstanding speaker. He's collaborative, friendly 
    and always brings a great energy. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending him for 
    any team.`,
